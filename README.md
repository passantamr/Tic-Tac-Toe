# Tic-Tac-Toe
<h3>This project involves building a Tic Tac Toe game using Python without a graphical user interface (GUI). The game will be played on the command line, where the user will enter their moves as text inputs. The project will focus on implementing the game logic using Python's built-in data structures and control flow statements. The project will include designing the game board as a list of lists, implementing the game logic using if statements and loops, and creating a simple command-line interface using Python's input() function. The project will also involve testing and debugging the game to ensure that it functions correctly. The game of Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their symbol (either X or O) on the grid, with the goal of getting three in a row. The game ends when either one player gets three in a row, or the grid is full without any player getting three in a row, resulting in a tie.</h3>
